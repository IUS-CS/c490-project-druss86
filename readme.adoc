= Synonymist

Definition: a specialist in the study or compiling of synonyms.

This application that allows the user to perfect their knowledge of synonyms and antonyms to become the ultimate synonymist! A random word will display at the bottom of the screen and then populate words into buttons in the middle of the screen.  The populated buttons will be either synonyms or antonyms of the word at the bottom of the screen and the user must choose the correct synonyms.  The app will test the user on their current knowledge of vocabulary as well as enhance their arsenal of words. 

== Section 1 – Motivation for Your App

The motivation behind this app was initially to fulfill requirements of this document; however, I realized the app is extremely scalable and may provide the opportunity to add many more features beyond just matching synonyms.  This game can be played by anyone, but the main target audience are english-speaking human beings with basic knowledge of the language.  

=== 1.1 Similar Application

There are many vocabulary apps that are somewhat in the realm of this application but I could only find one app that was an almost 1:1 match.

== Section 2 - Meeting Minimum Requirements

=== 2.1 User Interface

The same functionality in the applcation will work in either portrait or landscape views.  A ViewModel will be utilized to avoid losing a screen-state when rotating or switching between apps.  

There will be three screens to in this application:

. The main screen when loading the app - this screen will show some buttons that are selections of how the user would like to proceed.  From this screen, the user may select a "Play" button to go to screen 2 or a "Stats" to go to screen 3.
. The screen where the user plays the game.  A key word will appear at the bottom of the screen and buttons will populate (perhaps with some sort of animation) synonyms and antonyms centered vertically and horizontally in the middle of the screen based on the key word. A "Home" button will allow the user to return to the main menu screen. A "Stats" button will allow the user to view their running stats.
. The screen that allows the user to view statistics. TBD on what kind of statistics will be implemented. A "Home" button will allow the user to return to the main menu screen. A "Play" button will allow the user to play the game.

=== 2.2 Data Persistence

The application will store user statistics on their performance into an SQLite database. The amount of data will be small so it will be stored on the device that it is running on.  Storage of data will occur when the submit button is hit after each trivia word. Data will be retrieved at the onCreate of the Stats view.    

=== 2.3 Communication

There is a RESTful API called Datamuse that contains a large database of words, along with their associated synonyms and antonyms (among other things).  I plan to make HTTPS requests to the API, have it return the JSON, parse the JSON, and plug it where necessary. A Java handler exists for this particular API, called Datamuse4J.  In fact, this handler is listed on Datamuse's website as a reputable source for calling the API with java functions.  As Kotlin has the ability to use Java, the same methods apply to Kotlin.  Further, there are a couple guides online to get everything wired up with Kotlin.

=== 3.1 View Descriptions

*Main Screen:* +
The "Play" button loads the the "Play Screen View" where the user may play the game. +
The "Stats" button loads the the "Stats Screen View" where the user may view their statistics. 

*Play Screen:* +
The "Home" button takes the user to the Main Screen. +
The "Stats" button has the same functionality as the Main Screen. +
The "Keyword" button will load the word that will populate each Synonym/Antonym button.  This button will be wired to submit answers on the first click and refresh the board with a new word on a second click. +
The "Synonym/Antonym" button's functionality is simply a boolean value.  If left alone it indicates false, if depressed (clicked) it indicates true. 

*Stats Screen:* +
This view brings in defined information from the database and populates those areas. +
The "Home" and "Play" button have the same functionality as indicated in the other screen views.

=== 3.2 Model Descriptions

The model will need to store running user statistics in SQLite.  If the user were to suddenly close the application, the controller would need to be able to store information before exiting.  The plan is to never allow that issue to arise.  The controller will listen for the keyword button to be pressed for the submission of answers, and the information will then be stored.  Only when the keyword/submit button is pressed will data be stored.  Loading data will be done from loading the "Stats Screen View."

=== 3.3 Controller Descriptions

The controller will be in charge of telling the client views and model view what happens when a button is press. The Play, Home, and Stats buttons will have listeners to load views accordingly. Loading the Play view will send an HTTPS request at the time of onCreate, populating the user interface's buttons with words from the API. The Synonnyms/Antonyms buttons will have boolean values tied to them and will work with the Keyword button to send data from the controller to the database. Upon clicking the Keyword button (aka Submit), the fractional count of boolean values will be added to the database at that instant. Upon onCreate of the Stats Screen view, the controller will bring the required information from the model layer into the view.  The Stats view should either call finish() after exiting or an update upon reloading to assure up-to-date data is represented.
